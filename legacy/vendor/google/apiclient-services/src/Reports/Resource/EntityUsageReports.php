   * Retrieves a report which is a collection of properties and statistics for

   * Entities Usage Report guide. For more information about the entities report's
   * parameters, see the Entities Usage parameters reference guides.
   * (entityUsageReports.get)
   *
   * @param string $entityType Represents the type of entity for the report.
   * @param string $entityKey Represents the key of the object to filter the data
   * with. It is a string which can take the value `all` to get activity events
   * for all users, or any other value for an app-specific entity. For details on
   * how to obtain the `entityKey` for a particular `entityType`, see the Entities
   * Usage parameters reference guides.
   * @param string $date Represents the date the usage occurred, based on UTC-8:00
   * (Pacific Standard Time). The timestamp is in the [ISO 8601
   * format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), `yyyy-mm-dd`.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string customerId The unique ID of the customer to retrieve data
   * for.
   * @opt_param string filters The `filters` query string is a comma-separated
   * list of an application's event parameters where the parameter's value is
   * manipulated by a relational operator. The `filters` query string includes the
   * name of the application whose usage is returned in the report. The
   * application values for the Entities usage report include `accounts`, `docs`,
   * and `gmail`. Filters are in the form `[application name]:parameter
   * name[parameter value],...`. In this example, the `<>` 'not equal to' operator
   * is URL-encoded in the request's query string (%3C%3E): GET https://www.google
   * apis.com/admin/reports/v1/usage/gplus_communities/all/dates/2017-12-01
   * ?parameters=gplus:community_name,gplus:num_total_members
   * &filters=gplus:num_total_members%3C%3E0 The relational operators include: -
   * `==` - 'equal to'. - `<>` - 'not equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C%3E). - `<`
   * - 'less than'. It is URL-encoded (%3C). - `<=` - 'less than or equal to'. It
   * is URL-encoded (%3C=). - `>` - 'greater than'. It is URL-encoded (%3E). -
   * `>=` - 'greater than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3E=). Filters can only
   * be applied to numeric parameters.
   * @opt_param string maxResults Determines how many activity records are shown
   * on each response page. For example, if the request sets `maxResults=1` and
   * the report has two activities, the report has two pages. The response's
   * `nextPageToken` property has the token to the second page.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Token to specify next page. A report with
   * multiple pages has a `nextPageToken` property in the response. In your
   * follow-on request getting the next page of the report, enter the
   * `nextPageToken` value in the `pageToken` query string.
   * @opt_param string parameters The `parameters` query string is a comma-
   * separated list of event parameters that refine a report's results. The
   * parameter is associated with a specific application. The application values
   * for the Entities usage report are only `gplus`. A `parameter` query string is
   * in the CSV form of `[app_name1:param_name1], [app_name2:param_name2]...`.
   * *Note:* The API doesn't accept multiple values of a parameter. If a
   * particular parameter is supplied more than once in the API request, the API
   * only accepts the last value of that request parameter. In addition, if an
   * invalid request parameter is supplied in the API request, the API ignores
   * that request parameter and returns the response corresponding to the
   * remaining valid request parameters. An example of an invalid request
   * parameter is one that does not belong to the application. If no parameters
   * are requested, all parameters are returned.
   * @return UsageReports
   * @throws \Google\Service\Exception
