   * (default) or earlier. Format is YYYY-MM-DD.
   * @opt_param int pageSize Maximum number of days of reports to return. There
   * can be more than one rule report returned per day. For example, if 3 rule
   * types got applied to the same product within a 24-hour period, then a
   * page_size of 1 will return 3 rule reports. The page size defaults to 50 and
   * values above 1000 are coerced to 1000. This service may return fewer days of
   * reports than this value, for example, if the time between your start and end
   * date is less than the page size.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Token (if provided) to retrieve the subsequent
   * page. All other parameters must match the original call that provided the
   * page token.
   * @opt_param string ruleId Id of the Repricing rule. If specified, only gets
   * this rule's reports.
   * @opt_param string startDate Gets Repricing reports on and after this date in
   * the merchant's timezone, up to one year ago. Do not use a start date later
   * than 7 days ago (default). Format is YYYY-MM-DD.
