   * `approve` or `revoke`, respectively, and the `Content-Type` header to

   * keys are valid for API calls even though the keys are still approved. If

   * Content` To generate a new consumer key and secret for a developer app, pass
   * the new key/secret details. Rather than replace an existing key, this API
   * generates a new key. In this case, multiple key pairs may be associated with
   * a single developer app. Each key pair has an independent status (`approve` or
   * `revoke`) and expiration time. Any approved, non-expired key can be used in
   * an API call. For example, if you're using API key rotation, you can generate
   * new keys with expiration times that overlap keys that are going to expire.
   * You might also generate a new consumer key/secret if the security of the
   * original key/secret is compromised. The `keyExpiresIn` property defines the
   * expiration time for the API key in milliseconds. If you don't set this
   * property or set it to `-1`, the API key never expires. **Notes**: * When
   * generating a new key/secret, this API replaces the existing attributes,
   * notes, and callback URLs with those specified in the request. Include or
   * exclude any existing information that you want to retain or delete,
   * respectively. * To migrate existing consumer keys and secrets to hybrid from
   * another system, see the CreateDeveloperAppKey API.
