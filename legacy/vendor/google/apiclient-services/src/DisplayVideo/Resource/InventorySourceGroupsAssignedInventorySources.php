   * If unspecified will default to `100`. Returns error code `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
   * if an invalid value is specified.
   * @opt_param string pageToken A token identifying a page of results the server
   * should return. Typically, this is the value of next_page_token returned from
   * the previous call to `ListAssignedInventorySources` method. If not specified,
   * the first page of results will be returned.
