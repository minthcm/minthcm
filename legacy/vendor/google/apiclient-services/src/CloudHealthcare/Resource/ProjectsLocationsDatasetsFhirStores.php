  /**
   * Imports resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified
   * sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using
   * import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are
   * not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an
   * empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases where this
   * method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to load data. Every
   * resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each resource is
   * stored using the supplied ID regardless of the enable_update_create setting
   * on the FHIR store. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any
   * sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs.
   * Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and
   * Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference
   * fields within other resources. The import process does not enforce
   * referential integrity, regardless of the disable_referential_integrity
   * setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with arbitrary
   * interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but if the input
   * data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to be imported,
   * the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates referential integrity.
   * The import process does not trigger Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery
   * streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store.
   * If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent version
   * of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical version,
   * regardless of the disable_resource_versioning setting on the FHIR store. If
   * transient failures occur during the import, it's possible that successfully
   * imported resources will be overwritten more than once. The import operation
   * is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid resources with
   * the same ID but different contents. In that case, after the import completes,
   * the store contains exactly one resource with that ID but there is no ordering
   * guarantee on which version of the contents it will have. The operation result
   * counters do not count duplicate IDs as an error and count one success for
   * each resource in the input, which might result in a success count larger than
   * the number of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing
   * data organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything where each bundle
   * contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner that might be
   * referred to by many patients. If some resources fail to import, for example
   * due to parsing errors, successfully imported resources are not rolled back.
   * The location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters in
   * ImportResourcesRequest. Note that if no format is specified, this method
   * assumes the `BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method
   * ignores the `Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected,
   * and does not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or
   * transaction bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not
   * executed as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not
   * rewritten. The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written
   * as provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As
   * an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a FHIR
   * search or Patient-everything operation. This method returns an Operation that
   * can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation.
   * Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to
   * Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud
   * Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

   * searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text.
   * For example, `"Comment = great"` returns messages with `great` in the comment
   * field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an
   * exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the
   * equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators
   * (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You
   * can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field
   * value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the
   * RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and
   * days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality
   * operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`,
   * `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend
   * the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query
   * expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators
   * between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted
   * string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character
   * string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to
   * negate it. Only filtering on labels is supported, for example
   * `labels.key=value`.
