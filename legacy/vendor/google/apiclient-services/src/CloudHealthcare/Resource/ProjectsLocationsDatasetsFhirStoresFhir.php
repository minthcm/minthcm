   * result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`,
   * `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`. The maximum number of
   * search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the
   * `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. The server might return
   * fewer resources than requested to prevent excessively large responses. If
   * there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` contains a link of
   * `relation` "next", which has a `_page_token` parameter for an opaque
   * pagination token that can be used to retrieve the next page. Resources with a
   * total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be
   * fully searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those
   * cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a
   * slight delay between the time a resource is created or changed, and the time
   * when the change reflects in search results. The only exception is resource
   * identifier data, which is indexed synchronously as a special index. As a
   * result, searching using resource identifier is not subject to indexing delay.
   * To use the special synchronous index, the search term for identifier should

   * `_include` * `_revinclude` * `_summary` * `_elements` If your query contains
   * any other search parameters, the standard asynchronous index will be used
   * instead. Note that searching against the special index is optimized for
   * resolving a small number of matches. The search isn't optimized if your
